# GLOSSARY OF TERMS

## Basic Concepts
- **Elder Twin** - the larger number in a pair of simple twins (difference = 2)
- **Little Twin** - the smaller number in a pair of simple twins
- **Portal Line** - a segment that overlaps another segment, creating a transition between dimensions
- **Object Bonding Strength** - the number of lines that must be removed to separate objects

## Geometrical Terms
- **Parent Object** - the primary structure built from the initial sequence
- **Child Object** - the structure that arises from the overlapping of lines
- **Dimension** - the spatial layer in which objects exist
- **Overlap** - the situation when two segments pass along the same coordinates

## Statistical Parameters
- **Side Span** - the maximum deviation to the right and left from the origin Coordinates
- **Height** - maximum upward and downward deviation
- **Circumscribed Circle** - the smallest circle containing the entire figure
- **Circumscribed n-gon** - the smallest polygon with n angles containing the figure

## Algorithmic Terms
- **SB Filtering** - removing older twins from the sequence
- **Rotation -90°** - changing the direction clockwise by 90 degrees
- **Scaling** - the factor by which the figure is enlarged/reduced
